# ChatGPT-Basque
This bot has the objective of recreating a basic GPT chat (using the open ai api itself) but using basque as language. Type any question and wait for the bot to answer.

To get the translation. The bot uses the google translator package and translates the input from basque to spanish, since the GPT3 api understands it. Afterwards, it is time to translate the output to Basque.

Keep in mind that you must have your open ai account well configured since the computation necessary for the ai consumes credits.
